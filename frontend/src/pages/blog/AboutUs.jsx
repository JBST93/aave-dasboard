            Cryptocurrency is all the rage these days. However, especially in
            the past two days, we bet you’ve noticed that cryptocurrency prices
            are extremely volatile. You may have noticed that the yields on your
            crypto investments can change rapidly, with one platform offering
            the best rates today and another tomorrow. For crypto investors
            seeking to maximize their returns, it’s crucial to know where they
            can find the highest yields for their assets at any given moment.

            Being crypto farmers ourselves, we want to solve this problem and
            bring more transparency to the market by launching Cryptoradar, a
            real-time cryptocurrency price comparison website that not only
            gives you the best price but also lets you compare various exchanges
            based on different features.
          </p>
          <p>
            We wanted to offer a platform that aggregates interest rates and
            yields from across the DeFi landscape, presenting them in a clear
            and easy-to-use interface.

              investment goals.

            Our core feature is reflected in our name, Cryptoradar. A radar
            sends out electromagnetic waves which reflect off objects and return
            to the radar, giving information about the object’s location and
            speed. Instead of electromagnetic waves, Cryptoradar is sending out
            bits and bytes to cryptocurrency exchanges to determine the best
            available price.
